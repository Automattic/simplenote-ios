# Simplenote for iOS
A Simplenote client for iOS. Learn more about Simplenote at [Simplenote.com](https://simplenote.com).

## Build Instructions

### Download Xcode

At the moment *Simplenote for iOS* uses Swift 5 and requires Xcode 10.2 or newer. Xcode can be [downloaded from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action).*

### Third party tools

We use a few tools to help with development. To install or update the required dependencies, run the follow command on the command line:

`rake dependencies`

#### CocoaPods

Simplenote for iOS uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to manage third party libraries.
Third party libraries and resources managed by CocoaPods will be installed by the `rake dependencies` command above.

#### SwiftLint

We use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce a common style for Swift code. The app should build and work without it, but if you plan to write code, you are encouraged to install it. No commit should have lint warnings or errors.

You can set up a Git [pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to run SwiftLint automatically when committing by running:

`rake git:install_hooks`

This is the recommended way to include SwiftLint in your workflow, as it catches lint issues locally before your code makes its way to Github.

Alternately, a SwiftLint scheme is exposed within the project; Xcode will show a warning if you don't have SwiftLint installed.

Finally, you can also run SwiftLint manually from the command line with:

`rake lint`

If your code has any style violations, you can try to automatically correct them by running:

`rake lint:autocorrect`

Otherwise you have to fix them manually.

### Open Xcode

Launch the workspace by running the following from the command line:

`rake xcode`

This will ensure any dependencies are ready before launching Xcode.

You can also open the project by double clicking on Simplenote.xcworkspace file, or launching Xcode and choose `File` > `Open` and browse to `Simplenote.xcworkspace`.


## Setup Credentials

Simplenote is powered by the [Simperium Sync'ing protocol](https://www.simperium.com). We distribute **testing credentials** that help us authenticate your application, and verify that the API calls being made are valid.

**⚠️ Please note → We're not accepting any new Simperium accounts at this time.**

After you've created your own Simperium application, copy the sample config. For example:

```
mkdir -p Simplenote/Credentials && cp Simplenote/SPCredentials-demo.swift Simplenote/Credentials/SPCredentials.swift
```

Then edit the new `Simplenote/Credentials/SPCredentials.swift` file and change the `simperiumAppID` and `simperiumApiKey` fields to the correct values for your new app.

This will allow you to compile and run the app on a device or a simulator.

_Note: Simplenote API features such as sharing and publishing will not work with development builds._

### Optional

If you want to try the screenshots generation locally, also create your own testing credentials for that target:

```
mkdir -p SimplenoteScreenshots/Credentials && cp SimplenoteScreenshots/ScreenshotsCredentials-demo.swift SimplenoteScreenshots/Credentials/ScreenshotsCredentials.swift
```
