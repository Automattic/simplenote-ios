# We are using the API key to upload the metadata to ASC via Deliver, but, as
# the tool reports:
#
# > [!] Precheck cannot check In-app purchases with the App Store Connect API
# > Key (yet). Exclude In-app purchases from precheck, disable the precheck step
# > in your build step, or use Apple ID login
#
# Simplenote iOS doesn't use IAPs, for the moment, so we can safely skip them.
