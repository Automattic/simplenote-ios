Fundamentally, twelve-tone serialism is a compositional technique where all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are played with equal frequency throughout the piece without any emphasis on any one note. For this reason, twelve-tone serialism avoids being in any key. Arnold Schoenberg was arguably the most influential composers who embraced the twelve-tone technique. Schoenberg described the system as a “Method of composing with twelve tones which are related only with one another.”"
