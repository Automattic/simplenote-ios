# Contributing to Simplenote for iOS

Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing to the app, we really appreciate it.

There are many ways to contribute – reporting bugs, feature suggestions, fixing bugs, submitting pull requests for enhancements.

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, Sending Suggestions

Just [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Automattic/simplenote-ios/issues/), that’s all. If you want to prefix the title with a “Question:”, “Bug:”, "Feature Request:", or the general area of the application, that would be helpful, but by no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

If you’re filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include the part of the app that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead.  A screenshot is always helpful as well.

## Submitting code changes

We welcome Pull Requests for bug fixes on any open issues that you'd like to contribute!
